###The rules
There are 81 cards total, but at any given round, we’ll only give you 12 cards to play with. The goal is to find all the sets in the card (we’ll tell you how many there are, as it varies from round to round).  

- A card has 4 distinct features:
	-Shape: (example photos)
	-Color: (example photos)
	-Fill: (example photos)
	-Count: (example photos)
- A set contains 3 cards, where each of the features are either the same across three cards, or completely different.

###Fun facts about the game, and how it was built:
Set is a real-time card game designed by Marsha Falco in 1974 and published by Set Enterprises in 1991.

The largest group of cards you can put together without creating a set is 20.

There are 1080 unique sets.

Given ANY pair of card, there is a unique third card that makes a set.
